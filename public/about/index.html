<p>&ldquo;Tell me about yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have always dreaded this question. It doesn&rsquo;t matter which setting I&rsquo;m in - a social gathering, an interview, or while traveling - I invariably become visibly flabbergasted when people introduce themselves to me which is followed by the silent expectation that I&rsquo;d return the favor and say something about myself.</p>
<p>So to solve this little problem of mine, I came up with this unoriginal idea. Maybe I should make a website and put everything that goes on in my little mind out there so that whenever someone asks me to perform this horrendous task of saying something about myself, I&rsquo;ll simply point them towards &ldquo;The Lazy Oxymoron&rdquo; and say - that&rsquo;s me.</p>
<p>I know, how genius of me!</p>
<p>Now, if you have managed to read this far without rolling your eyes too much, I&rsquo;ll tell you something about myself.</p>
<p>I am Siddhartha. Although most of my friends know me by my nickname &lsquo;Golu&rsquo; - which is also part of my full name btw - but that&rsquo;s a story for some other time. I am currently engaged in building <a href="https://www.one800.help/">One800</a> which is going to consume a lot of my personal and professional time for the forseeable future, so do excuse any delay in responses.</p>
<p>I am passionate about a lot of things, which by its nature, leads me to become anxious a lot because I can&rsquo;t fulfill them all. I love reading books (fiction, non-fiction, poetry, comics, magazines - pretty much anything) and have a tiny but increasing library at home. Music, drawing, and photography are some of the things that I don&rsquo;t have a lot of talent for, nevertheless, I find them to be great creative stimulants, and so I dabble here and there with my amateur hands. Whenever I find the time - or rather I absolutely make the time to do this - I travel. You&rsquo;ll often hear people say this, so much that it might&rsquo;ve started sounding like bullshit, but it&rsquo;s true - traveling changes you. I can get carried away with this, so let&rsquo;s keep this for a future post.</p>
<p>If you want to get in touch with me, the easiest way would be to go the old fashioned way - drop me an email at <a href="mailto:sid@siddharthagolu.com">sid@siddharthagolu.com</a>. I reply to every email I get (which is once in a blue moon).</p>
