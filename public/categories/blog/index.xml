      <description>&lt;p&gt;Depression is a very heavy handed word, and probably the most misunderstood one too. It stealthily engulfs you in its tight grasp,&#xA;attackiong when you least expect it to. One moment you&amp;rsquo;re enjoying the weather, basking in the glory of some happy thought, maybe&#xA;remembering that on thing that your partner did for you - and suddenly from this wave of happy and positive emotions, a tiny&#xA;splash comes towards you - the splash of doubt. Was your colleague being sarcastic when he was praising your work?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
