Maybe this is a nasty by-product of wanting to be as &amp;ldquo;productive&amp;rdquo; as possible. But the more I have drifted away from reading for pleasure, more mechanical the whole process has become for me. Partly to avoid this feeling, and partly because of my shame at seeing my bookshelf filled with dusty unread books, I picked up this one to assuage my feelings of guilt.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Although this is not because I hate exercises - one of those rare things that I figured out early in life was my desire to remain healthy as long as possible and that of course means I need to keep myself fit - but probably my distaste for running stems from the monotonous nature of the activity. You keep pounding your legs with a short breath and no rest in sight, what is there to&#xA;enjoy and look forward to?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

What the cultural multitudes and colorful festivals hide underneath is an ugly facade which threatens to break everything that has been built over the years. What I find most fascinating is how we&amp;rsquo;ve conditioned ourselves to ignore the blatant reality and move ahead with an oblivious calm, living in shit and aspiring for the gold.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I followed the typical path of receiving a particular religion from my parents (born a &amp;ldquo;Hindu child&amp;rdquo;), which had a supporting role in my life up until my late-teenage/early-adolescent years.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I was pleasantly surprised to find instead a good collection of technical essays covering the workings of RBI, and economics in general. If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a good explanatory work in the field of Economics (and especially those concerning India and its policies), you&amp;rsquo;ll enjoy this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Some of the most intimate moments I&amp;rsquo;ve spent alone is while reading fictional stories, while at the same time, feeling a pang of disappointment for myself because I wasn&amp;rsquo;t doing anything &amp;ldquo;productive.&amp;rdquo; Is this mere entertainment? Am I just escaping my real-life responsibilities and reading stories of make-believe? While I still haven&amp;rsquo;t found sincere answers to these questions, I&amp;rsquo;ve grown more confident of what I enjoy and what I don&amp;rsquo;t, which has consequently helped me find peace with this conflict. Over the years, I&amp;rsquo;ve realized that reading good literature is therapeutic for me - not to be used as an afterthought but essential to keep me functional.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

There was a profile of her in Wired, with an eye-catching image of her wearing a turtleneck black sweater holding what looked like a test-tube with a tiny amount of blood with a science-y background. I remember it had made quite a distinct impression on my mind, no doubt helped by the fact that the profile had described her as &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;this Stanford dropout 20-something who was hailed as being a younger version of Einstein, was going to change the world&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But it disappointed in almost every domain that I had expectations in. Using deep-sounding difficult words and wrapping them in an almost mythical aura of &amp;ldquo;Consciousness&amp;rdquo;, this one was a huge letdown. The irony is that I&amp;rsquo;ve been following his mindfulness meditation course and it&amp;rsquo;s been the opposite experience there - in fact, his meditation course itself was what motivated me to pick up this book.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

How can you combine over 2000 years of human history and still do justice to every element? But the unique manner in which this book - or more appropriately, collection of letters - has been written, it shines brightly amongst the plethora of history books you can find on this vast subject of world history.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Despite this lifelong love affair with music of all kinds, there was one particular genre of music that always baffled me. Mostly because of my own ignorance, but partially also because nobody else was talking about it. Nobody else in my own vicinity that is. It didn&amp;rsquo;t play on the radio, you won&amp;rsquo;t hear it playing on any of the countless music channels and certainly, nobody was going on tours giving live performances.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

You ponder about it for days to come, want to scream your head off about it to anyone who&amp;rsquo;d listen, and then dwell in this fear of picking up another book because how can something else ever come close to being this perfect!&#xA;I have felt this way before - first when I&amp;rsquo;d finished &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/188572.The_Complete_Sherlock_Holmes&#34;&gt;The Complete Sherlock&#xA;Holmes&lt;/a&gt;, later when I was left&#xA;in a daze for multiple days after finishing the notorious and brilliant &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1736892374&#34;&gt;House of Leaves&lt;/a&gt;, and much more recently when I was unable&#xA;to sleep after reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2630378184&#34;&gt;Why We Sleep by Matthew Walker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The last few chapters were a slog to get through - mostly because of numerous &amp;ldquo;business-class&amp;rdquo; style case studies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Main takeaway? Other than the central idea around which the book revolves (and succinctly mentioned as the book subtitle too), the&#xA;idea of interleaving is what struck me the most. I had already read about this particular method in &lt;strong&gt;Michael Nielsen&amp;rsquo;s brilliant&#xA;post&lt;/strong&gt; on Anki (&lt;a href=&#34;http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Augmenting Long-term Memory&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;) and it was interesting to read about it formally in the book. Interleaving is the technique of mixing up your learning in varied environments so that it makes some unusual connections that you&amp;rsquo;d normally won&amp;rsquo;t think about - and might come in handy when you are faced with a problem in a new environment you haven&amp;rsquo;t previously encountered.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;preamble&#34;&gt;Preamble&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Philosophy has always been one of those baffling things that entice you at first by its simplicity, but as you get sucked into it more and more, you find yourself searching for the end of this labyrinthine landscape. I had my first exposure to anything related to philosophy in my second year of college when I stumbled upon &lt;strong&gt;The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand&lt;/strong&gt;. At the time, it was one of the fascinating books I had ever read. I distinctly remember sitting down with the book at 9 PM having had my dinner, and as the custom goes, was looking forward to reading anything that could distract me from the mountain load of coursework that I had to finish for the upcoming semester exams. I became so engrossed in the story that when I finished the book and went outside to take in a fresh breath of air - I was startled to discover that the sunlight was already shining throughout the corridor - it was 7 o&amp;rsquo;clock in the morning!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
