<h2 id="deference-vs-indifference">Deference vs. Indifference</h2>
<p>There used to be a time<br>
when things used to be simple.<br>
I&rsquo;d wake up, rub my eyes, sit up straight, close my eyes,<br>
And pray that He will continue to guide me<br>
as He had done the previous day.<br>
There used to be a time<br>
when I used to love the aroma<br>
of the stick when it burned,<br>
lighting up my day with the secret enchantments,<br>
as if the secrecy itself was the source of my happiness.</p>
<p>There used to be a time<br>
when coming home after a bad day,<br>
I&rsquo;d sit on my bed and join my hands and close my eyes<br>
and quietly shed a tear.<br>
The statues didn&rsquo;t move or speak or whisper,<br>
but I felt assured that somehow those little stones<br>
were the only ones who listened to me<br>
and answered back.</p>
<p>But now,<br>
I wake up and lie on my bed for hours,<br>
watching the fan complete circles after circles after circles,<br>
as if I was stuck in the middle while everyone else around me<br>
kept going through life as if it was such an easy task.<br>
But now,<br>
The smell of the burning stick nauseates my senses,<br>
the secret spells make me mad,<br>
the constant enchantings feel as if someone lit a person on fire<br>
while they were sleeping.<br>
But now,<br>
when I come back home after a bad day,<br>
to the empty apartment echoing with silence so loud<br>
I worry my neighbors will start complaining -<br>
Even crying for hours doesn&rsquo;t help.</p>
<p>Sometimes I think,<br>
what use is consciousness<br>
if it doesn&rsquo;t make you happy but slowly takes away<br>
whatever little sanity you had left<br>
second by second.<br>
Sometimes I worry,<br>
Did I make a mistake in choosing not to follow blindly?<br>
Does asking questions that nobody has answers to<br>
makes me more alive<br>
or merely leaves me more broken and naive and stupid?<br>
Is ignorance really bliss?</p>
<p>I still go to churches and mosques and temples,<br>
the difference being it was deference before,<br>
and now it&rsquo;s curiosity about the people who go there<br>
and indifference to the thing they pray to.</p>
<p>Sometimes I wonder,<br>
There really is no answer, is there?</p>

<p>A poem I wrote when I had troubles accepting myself. Still do, to be honest.</p>
