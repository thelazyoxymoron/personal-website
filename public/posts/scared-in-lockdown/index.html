<p>I&rsquo;m scared.</p>
<p>No, not because there&rsquo;s a pandemic going on,<br>
even though that itself is enough<br>
to make one lose their mind.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another deadly virus crawling<br>
its way into my whole being.<br>
Slowly eating away at my sanity,<br>
feasting on my thoughts,<br>
mutating inside my head as if a colony of ants was given<br>
an open invitation to a room full of sugary syrup.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m disintegrating.</p>
<p>Funny how the same thoughts,<br>
who once used to tell me there&rsquo;s an ocean of possibilities out there;<br>
are slowly drowning me into the same pool,<br>
replacing me, devouring me<br>
bit-by-bit<br>
as if my feet are tied with stones of expectations<br>
and I keep swimming to the bottom, mistaking it for the shore.</p>
<p>Splash. Splash. Splash.</p>
<p>I see people making art, saving lives, reading books, writing novels,<br>
cooking food, running home marathons -<br>
resolving to turn this gloom into resilient happiness.<br>
And I can&rsquo;t help but feel disgusted<br>
at my curled up crying self in the bedroom corner,<br>
struggling to tell apart midnight from noon.</p>
<p>When I go to the kitchen to make my first<br>
(and only) meal of the day,<br>
the knife shivers, even though my hands are steady<br>
it fears for the fingers that are too close to the blunt edge,<br>
fearing that as the layers of onions come apart,
the body holding the knife<br>
will shed its pretentious layers as well,<br>
baring naked the vast void in the center.</p>
<p>How many layers will I have to cut<br>
before I find myself again?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m scared to find out.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s hope.<br>
A distant glimmer at the horizon, but it&rsquo;s there.<br>
Counting my breath, one step at a time,<br>
dragging myself through the dark tunnel,<br>
following the whisper that says</p>
<p>it gets better.<br>
it always does.<br>
it has to.</p>

<p>A poem penned down during the Coronavirus pandemic. I see people who are struggling with mental health issues which, I can only imagine, would have exacerbated during these times. Take care of yourself, folks. Don&rsquo;t forget that you matter. A lot.</p>
