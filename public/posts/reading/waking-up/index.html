<p>Disappointed.</p>
<p>I am an atheist interested in the power of mindfulness and the whole world of so-called spirituality, so naturally, I am the ideal audience that Sam Harris is looking for. But it disappointed in almost every domain that I had expectations in. Using deep-sounding difficult words and wrapping them in an almost mythical aura of &ldquo;Consciousness&rdquo;, this one was a huge letdown. The irony is that I&rsquo;ve been following his mindfulness meditation course and it&rsquo;s been the opposite experience there - in fact, his meditation course itself was what motivated me to pick up this book.</p>
<p>Save yourself the trouble of reading on why to meditate and instead dive into doing the practice itself and judge for yourself.</p>
