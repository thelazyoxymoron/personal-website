<h2 id="world-history-in-a-nutshell">World history in a nutshell</h2>
<p>More than 1100 pages, this behemoth of a book still fails to capture the whole essence of world history - and rightly so. How can you combine over 2000 years of human history and still do justice to every element? But the unique manner in which this book - or more appropriately, collection of letters - has been written, it shines brightly amongst the plethora of history books you can find on this vast subject of world history.</p>
<p>Lately and unfortunately, people in my country have been going down a dangerous political hole and it is almost becoming a fashion statement now to indulge in tales of <em>&ldquo;revisionist history&rdquo;</em>, especially when it&rsquo;s related to foundations of India and the exact roles played by political parties of the time. It&rsquo;s shameful to hear people bashing Nehru for whatever &ldquo;wrongs&rdquo; he committed, while at the same time, being ignorant about his accomplishments and the monumentally difficult task he faced of leading and building India during its first few years of Independence.</p>
<p>The personal nature of the letters and the choice of the subject notwithstanding - or more accurately, I should say <em>because</em> of these characteristics - this book is also a revealing window to the character and intelligence of our first Prime Minister.</p>
<p>This one would surely go onto my favorites&rsquo; stand :)</p>
