<p>I have been riding motorcycles for past 7 years. I&rsquo;ve had so many crashes in the early days that people were afraid of sitting as a pillion on my bike. Slowly I started internalizing few things and gradually the accidents stopped. This is a typical journey of how you learn any skill. However, it becomes a problem if you never give yourself a chance to see your skills from first principles and examine bad patterns that you might have internalized.</p>
<p>Reading this book was a refreshing reminder to examine how I ride a motorcycle.</p>
<p>This didn&rsquo;t teach me anything extraordinary, but it explained so many things that I had, just sort of, accepted as given. Like how tyre pressure affects a bike&rsquo;s traction, why counter-steering works, why front brakes are much more powerful (and should be used more frequently) than rear brakes, and on and on.</p>
<p>Pick up this book if you&rsquo;d like to improve, and understand, how you ride.</p>
