<p>Started with a tightly-knit structure, but faltered at the end. The last few chapters were a slog to get through - mostly because of numerous &ldquo;business-class&rdquo; style case studies.</p>
<p>Main takeaway? Other than the central idea around which the book revolves (and succinctly mentioned as the book subtitle too), the
idea of interleaving is what struck me the most. I had already read about this particular method in <strong>Michael Nielsen&rsquo;s brilliant
post</strong> on Anki (<a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html">&ldquo;Augmenting Long-term Memory&rdquo;</a>) and it was interesting to read about it formally in the book. Interleaving is the technique of mixing up your learning in varied environments so that it makes some unusual connections that you&rsquo;d normally won&rsquo;t think about - and might come in handy when you are faced with a problem in a new environment you haven&rsquo;t previously encountered.</p>
<p>In the end, &ldquo;Range&rdquo; suffers from the same deficiencies that a lot of other pop-psychology/self-management books suffer from - too many anecdotal evidence and case studies. A reviewer here on Goodreads summed it the best:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Finally, Range is designed to appeal to people who are already skeptical of specialization/ enthusiastic about generalized skillsets. I worry that some of the appreciation of this book is just a soothing exercise in confirmation bias for generalists.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Still, I&rsquo;d recommend it to people who (like me) are skeptical about their tendency to dabble in too many disparate fields at the same time - this might be the soothing pill that you were looking for.</p>
