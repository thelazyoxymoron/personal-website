    <h1>On Depression and Recovery</h1>

      <p>Depression is a very heavy handed word, and probably the most misunderstood one too. It stealthily engulfs you in its tight grasp,
attackiong when you least expect it to. One moment you&rsquo;re enjoying the weather, basking in the glory of some happy thought, maybe
remembering that on thing that your partner did for you - and suddenly from this wave of happy and positive emotions, a tiny
splash comes towards you - the splash of doubt. Was your colleague being sarcastic when he was praising your work?</p>
