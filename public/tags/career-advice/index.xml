      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2918108710&#34;&gt;Check it out on Goodreads&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.siddharthagolu.com/images/range_kindle.webp#center&#34; alt=&#34;Range cover&#34; title=&#34;Range cover&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Started with a tightly-knit structure, but faltered at the end. The last few chapters were a slog to get through - mostly because of numerous &amp;ldquo;business-class&amp;rdquo; style case studies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Main takeaway? Other than the central idea around which the book revolves (and succinctly mentioned as the book subtitle too), the&#xA;idea of interleaving is what struck me the most. I had already read about this particular method in &lt;strong&gt;Michael Nielsen&amp;rsquo;s brilliant&#xA;post&lt;/strong&gt; on Anki (&lt;a href=&#34;http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Augmenting Long-term Memory&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;) and it was interesting to read about it formally in the book. Interleaving is the technique of mixing up your learning in varied environments so that it makes some unusual connections that you&amp;rsquo;d normally won&amp;rsquo;t think about - and might come in handy when you are faced with a problem in a new environment you haven&amp;rsquo;t previously encountered.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
