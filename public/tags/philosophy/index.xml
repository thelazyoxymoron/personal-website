      <description>&lt;p&gt;Verdict: &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; ★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆ &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterboxd.com/carte_blanche/film/waking-life/&#34;&gt;Check it out on Letterboxd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are films which you wish you had watched earlier in life, and there are others which don&amp;rsquo;t make sense until you have had your fair share of world experiences. Waking Life falls in the former category.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The college sophomore me would have been really excited about discussing vague notions of self and freedom and free will and morality and dreams - and don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, mid-twenties me is equally as excited about these things as my former self, if not more so - but the problem lies in the superficiality of it all. Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve had more nuanced discussions about these philosophical conundrums and have read a fair amount of academic literature, the surface level discussions here leave a lot to be desired.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;preamble&#34;&gt;Preamble&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Philosophy has always been one of those baffling things that entice you at first by its simplicity, but as you get sucked into it more and more, you find yourself searching for the end of this labyrinthine landscape. I had my first exposure to anything related to philosophy in my second year of college when I stumbled upon &lt;strong&gt;The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand&lt;/strong&gt;. At the time, it was one of the fascinating books I had ever read. I distinctly remember sitting down with the book at 9 PM having had my dinner, and as the custom goes, was looking forward to reading anything that could distract me from the mountain load of coursework that I had to finish for the upcoming semester exams. I became so engrossed in the story that when I finished the book and went outside to take in a fresh breath of air - I was startled to discover that the sunlight was already shining throughout the corridor - it was 7 o&amp;rsquo;clock in the morning!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
