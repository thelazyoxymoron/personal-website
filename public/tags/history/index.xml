      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2891482793&#34;&gt;Check it out on Goodreads&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;world-history-in-a-nutshell&#34;&gt;World history in a nutshell&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;More than 1100 pages, this behemoth of a book still fails to capture the whole essence of world history - and rightly so. How can you combine over 2000 years of human history and still do justice to every element? But the unique manner in which this book - or more appropriately, collection of letters - has been written, it shines brightly amongst the plethora of history books you can find on this vast subject of world history.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3030817409&#34;&gt;Check it out on Goodreads&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have been a lover of music since my early childhood - runs in the family - and have imitated and performed songs (mostly inside my own head) on numerous occasions. Despite this lifelong love affair with music of all kinds, there was one particular genre of music that always baffled me. Mostly because of my own ignorance, but partially also because nobody else was talking about it. Nobody else in my own vicinity that is. It didn&amp;rsquo;t play on the radio, you won&amp;rsquo;t hear it playing on any of the countless music channels and certainly, nobody was going on tours giving live performances.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
