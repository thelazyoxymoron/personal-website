      <description>&lt;p&gt;Verdict: &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; ★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆ &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterboxd.com/carte_blanche/film/waking-life/&#34;&gt;Check it out on Letterboxd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are films which you wish you had watched earlier in life, and there are others which don&amp;rsquo;t make sense until you have had your fair share of world experiences. Waking Life falls in the former category.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The college sophomore me would have been really excited about discussing vague notions of self and freedom and free will and morality and dreams - and don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, mid-twenties me is equally as excited about these things as my former self, if not more so - but the problem lies in the superficiality of it all. Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve had more nuanced discussions about these philosophical conundrums and have read a fair amount of academic literature, the surface level discussions here leave a lot to be desired.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
