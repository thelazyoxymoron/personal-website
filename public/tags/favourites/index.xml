Maybe this is a nasty by-product of wanting to be as &amp;ldquo;productive&amp;rdquo; as possible. But the more I have drifted away from reading for pleasure, more mechanical the whole process has become for me. Partly to avoid this feeling, and partly because of my shame at seeing my bookshelf filled with dusty unread books, I picked up this one to assuage my feelings of guilt.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What I Talk About When I Talk About Running by Haruki Murakami</title>

Although this is not because I hate exercises - one of those rare things that I figured out early in life was my desire to remain healthy as long as possible and that of course means I need to keep myself fit - but probably my distaste for running stems from the monotonous nature of the activity. You keep pounding your legs with a short breath and no rest in sight, what is there to&#xA;enjoy and look forward to?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

What the cultural multitudes and colorful festivals hide underneath is an ugly facade which threatens to break everything that has been built over the years. What I find most fascinating is how we&amp;rsquo;ve conditioned ourselves to ignore the blatant reality and move ahead with an oblivious calm, living in shit and aspiring for the gold.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I followed the typical path of receiving a particular religion from my parents (born a &amp;ldquo;Hindu child&amp;rdquo;), which had a supporting role in my life up until my late-teenage/early-adolescent years.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Verdict: &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterboxd.com/carte_blanche/film/oslo-august-31st/&#34;&gt;Check it out on Letterboxd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Motorcycling community is laden with fist-pumping-muscle-bulging-neckbeardy-speed-ninjas-Harley-fans, and it usually gets a bad rap all across the world. Gaurav Jani is none of these things. His passion and humility and curious nature reminded me why I loved biking in the first place. This is a must-watch for anyone fascinated with two wheels and the places they enable you to visit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Glimpses of World History by Jawaharlal Nehru</title>

How can you combine over 2000 years of human history and still do justice to every element? But the unique manner in which this book - or more appropriately, collection of letters - has been written, it shines brightly amongst the plethora of history books you can find on this vast subject of world history.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to Listen to and Understand Great Music by Robert Greenberg</title>

Despite this lifelong love affair with music of all kinds, there was one particular genre of music that always baffled me. Mostly because of my own ignorance, but partially also because nobody else was talking about it. Nobody else in my own vicinity that is. It didn&amp;rsquo;t play on the radio, you won&amp;rsquo;t hear it playing on any of the countless music channels and certainly, nobody was going on tours giving live performances.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

You ponder about it for days to come, want to scream your head off about it to anyone who&amp;rsquo;d listen, and then dwell in this fear of picking up another book because how can something else ever come close to being this perfect!&#xA;I have felt this way before - first when I&amp;rsquo;d finished &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/188572.The_Complete_Sherlock_Holmes&#34;&gt;The Complete Sherlock&#xA;Holmes&lt;/a&gt;, later when I was left&#xA;in a daze for multiple days after finishing the notorious and brilliant &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1736892374&#34;&gt;House of Leaves&lt;/a&gt;, and much more recently when I was unable&#xA;to sleep after reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2630378184&#34;&gt;Why We Sleep by Matthew Walker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
