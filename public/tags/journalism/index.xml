There was a profile of her in Wired, with an eye-catching image of her wearing a turtleneck black sweater holding what looked like a test-tube with a tiny amount of blood with a science-y background. I remember it had made quite a distinct impression on my mind, no doubt helped by the fact that the profile had described her as &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;this Stanford dropout 20-something who was hailed as being a younger version of Einstein, was going to change the world&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
