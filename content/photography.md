My fascination with the visual media brought me closer to seeing the world through a different lens. This is an ongoing effort to capture what I see and share it with the world.

You can browse the images below using left/right keys. All the images are hosted on flickr, I'd recommend navigating to my photostream if you want to see them in full size.[^1]
