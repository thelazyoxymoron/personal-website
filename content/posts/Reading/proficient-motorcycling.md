I have been riding motorcycles for past 7 years. I've had so many crashes in the early days that people were afraid of sitting as a pillion on my bike. Slowly I started internalizing few things and gradually the accidents stopped. This is a typical journey of how you learn any skill. However, it becomes a problem if you never give yourself a chance to see your skills from first principles and examine bad patterns that you might have internalized.

Reading this book was a refreshing reminder to examine how I ride a motorcycle.

This didn't teach me anything extraordinary, but it explained so many things that I had, just sort of, accepted as given. Like how tyre pressure affects a bike's traction, why counter-steering works, why front brakes are much more powerful (and should be used more frequently) than rear brakes, and on and on.

Pick up this book if you'd like to improve, and understand, how you ride.
