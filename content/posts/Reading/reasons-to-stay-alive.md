------------------------------------------------

**Reasons you should read this book:**

1) If you've ever had a panic attack. 
2) If you've ever counted the number of times the ceiling fan rotates, just so you could avoid dealing with the endless voices in your head. 
3) If you've ever felt ashamed to admit that you might be suffering from the D-word. 
4) If reading about personal stories of how people overcame their mental illnesses soothes you. 
5) Because why not. 

A lucid, non-linear and a sort of haphazard look at the most personal struggle anyone can go through, give this one a read if you want to know what it feels like to have depression.
