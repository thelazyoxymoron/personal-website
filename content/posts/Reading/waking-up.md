## A disappointing jumble of thoughts

Disappointed.

I am an atheist interested in the power of mindfulness and the whole world of so-called spirituality, so naturally, I am the ideal audience that Sam Harris is looking for. But it disappointed in almost every domain that I had expectations in. Using deep-sounding difficult words and wrapping them in an almost mythical aura of "Consciousness", this one was a huge letdown. The irony is that I've been following his mindfulness meditation course and it's been the opposite experience there - in fact, his meditation course itself was what motivated me to pick up this book. 

Save yourself the trouble of reading on why to meditate and instead dive into doing the practice itself and judge for yourself.
