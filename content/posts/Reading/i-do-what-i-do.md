 I had picked up this one thinking it to be an autobiography, and with an expectation that it'll cover Rajan's tussles with the government in more details. I was pleasantly surprised to find instead a good collection of technical essays covering the workings of RBI, and economics in general. If you're looking for a good explanatory work in the field of Economics (and especially those concerning India and its policies), you'll enjoy this.
