---------------------

A slow, methodical display of patience and absurdity juxtaposed on the vast landscape, this film has something else going for it. When you read the synopsis or look at the posters, you expect a certain police procedural drama - the kind of which you've been accustomed to till date. What you get is a completely different take on the trope.

The cinematography seems out of this world, and the melancholic doctor only adds to the moodiness of the whole atmosphere. One little scene in the middle will remain in my heart for a long time.
