You can spot Wes Anderson trademark from a mile ago, although this is the only movie by him which left me dissatisfied. The unique and swift camera movements are still there, the colors still pop out like from another universe, the absurd comic timings still bring a smile to your face - but you won't feel the kind of personal emotional investment into the characters like you would in the rest of his filmography. Still, for a Wes Anderson fan, this would be a nice enough movie.
