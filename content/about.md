I've always struggled with the question "Tell me about yourself". It doesn't matter if I'm at a social gathering, an interview, or traveling - I freeze up and find myself at a loss for words. So, I created this space as a solution. Now whenever someone asks, I simply point them here.

Now that you're here, let me introduce myself.

## Background
I'm Siddhartha, but most people know me by my nickname 'Golu' (which is also part of my full name, but that's a story for some other time) or Sid. I'm currently fully engaged in building [One800](https://www.one800.help/) - an online platform for mobile repairs. Prior to One800, I used to work as a Software engineer at Intel. I've done my Bachelor's and Master's in Computer Science from IIT (BHU), Varanasi.

## Passions

* **Reading**: I love reading books and have consciously curated my life to help me read more every day. I read widely across subjects - from philosophy, literary fiction, history, psychology to biography, comics and magazines - and make sure to have a dedicated block to read in the morning. You can find some of my notes on books I've read [here](/categories/book-notes/).

* **Tinkering**: A huge chunk of my personal time goes into hacking on some projects. It could be a new LLM that I just came across, or finding a way to automate some of the repetitive stuffs, or figuring out the best possible way to do [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten). I love my time spent here, but sometimes I get carried away and forget about time, which is also a good thing and a bad thing depending on the circumstance.

## Reach out

If you want to get in touch with me, the easiest way would be to go the old fashioned way - drop me an email at [sid@siddharthagolu.com](mailto:sid@siddharthagolu.com). It's the quickest way to get a reply from me.

Or if you prefer, you can also connect with me on the following social media sites:

If you connect with my thoughts here, please do reach out to me via your preferred medium. After all, we all live for the human connections we make.

Stay curious,  
Siddhartha
