"Tell me about yourself."

I have always dreaded this question. It doesn't matter which setting I'm in - a social gathering, an interview, or while traveling - I invariably become visibly flabbergasted when people introduce themselves to me which is followed by the silent expectation that I'd return the favor and say something about myself. 

So to solve this little problem of mine, I came up with this unoriginal idea. Maybe I should make a website and put everything that goes on in my little mind out there so that whenever someone asks me to perform this horrendous task of saying something about myself, I'll simply point them towards "The Lazy Oxymoron" and say - that's me.

I know, how genius of me!

Now, if you have managed to read this far without rolling your eyes too much, I'll tell you something about myself.

I am Siddhartha. Although most of my friends know me by my nickname 'Golu' - which is also part of my full name btw - but that's a story for some other time. I am currently engaged in building [One800](https://www.one800.help/) which is going to consume a lot of my personal and professional time for the forseeable future, so do excuse any delay in responses.

I am passionate about a lot of things, which by its nature, leads me to become anxious a lot because I can't fulfill them all. I love reading books (fiction, non-fiction, poetry, comics, magazines - pretty much anything) and have a tiny but increasing library at home. Music, drawing, and photography are some of the things that I don't have a lot of talent for, nevertheless, I find them to be great creative stimulants, and so I dabble here and there with my amateur hands. Whenever I find the time - or rather I absolutely make the time to do this - I travel. You'll often hear people say this, so much that it might've started sounding like bullshit, but it's true - traveling changes you. I can get carried away with this, so let's keep this for a future post.

If you want to get in touch with me, the easiest way would be to go the old fashioned way - drop me an email at [sid@siddharthagolu.com](mailto:sid@siddharthagolu.com). I reply to every email I get (which is once in a blue moon).
